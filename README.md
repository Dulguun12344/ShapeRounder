# ShapeRounder ‚ú®

**ShapeRounder** is a powerful and precise Adobe Photoshop script designed to bring advanced vector path corner rounding capabilities directly into your workflow. Offering full per-point control, smart Bezier math, and a non-destructive editing process, it empowers you to refine any path with exceptional accuracy.

Unlike Photoshop‚Äôs native shape rounding‚Äîwhich is limited to specific live shapes like rectangles or rounded rectangles‚ÄîShapeRounder works universally on **any vector path**. This includes Work Paths, Vector Masks on layers, paths defining Shape Layers, and complex shapes drawn manually with the Pen Tool.

> **Note**: The name *ShapeRounder* was inspired by a similarly named commercial plugin. However, this script is an **independent project**, built entirely from scratch as a **free and open-source alternative**. It focuses on enhanced precision, customizable options, and aims to replicate Adobe‚Äôs native curvature formula as closely as possible within the ExtendScript environment.

## ü§î Why ShapeRounder?

Vector path refinement is crucial for clean and professional designs. While Adobe Illustrator excels at this, Photoshop's native tools are often insufficient for complex paths or precise control. ShapeRounder bridges this gap by providing:

*   **Universal Path Support:** Works on *any* path type, not just basic shapes.
*   **Granular Control:** Choose between global rounding, angle-based filtering, or precise per-point radius adjustments.
*   **Mathematical Precision:** Uses a Bezier arc approximation formula reverse-engineered from Adobe Photoshop‚Äôs native shape rounding behavior. By analyzing the control points of live rounded shapes, ShapeRounder replicates the exact curvature formula for smooth, predictable results that match Adobe‚Äôs internal logic.
*   **Non-Destructive Process:** Your original path is always preserved.
*   **Free and Open Source:** An accessible tool for everyone.

It's built for designers, illustrators, and UI artists who need Illustrator-level corner rounding control without leaving Photoshop.

## üìÇ Installation

You have two ways to use ShapeRounder:

### Option 1: Manual Install (Recommended)

This makes the script readily available in Photoshop's Scripts menu.

1.  **Locate your Photoshop Scripts folder:**
    *   **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop [Version]\Presets\Scripts\`
    *   **macOS:** `/Applications/Adobe Photoshop [Version]/Presets/Scripts/`
    *(Replace `[Version]` with your specific Photoshop version, e.g., `Adobe Photoshop 2024`)*
    *(Note: You might need administrator privileges to copy files into Program Files on Windows)*
2.  **Copy `ShapeRounder.jsx`** into this `Scripts` folder.
3.  **Restart Adobe Photoshop.** If Photoshop was already running, you need to restart it for the script to appear in the menu.
4.  **Access the script** via `File > Scripts > ShapeRounder`.

### Option 2: Run on Demand

Use this method if you prefer not to install the script permanently.

1.  Save `ShapeRounder.jsx` to a convenient location on your computer (e.g., Desktop, a dedicated scripts folder).
2.  In Photoshop, go to `File > Scripts > Browse...`.
3.  Navigate to where you saved `ShapeRounder.jsx` and select it.
4.  Click **Open**. The script will run immediately.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Guide

Follow these steps to round corners on your paths:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Path

Ensure your Photoshop document is open and contains at least one vector path. This can be:
*   A **Work Path** visible in the Paths panel.
*   The path associated with a **Shape Layer**.
*   The path defining a **Vector Mask** on any layer.

*(Tip: For best results, ensure your path doesn't have overlapping points or zero-length segments at the corners you intend to round.)*

### Step 2: Launch ShapeRounder

Go to `File > Scripts > ShapeRounder` (if installed) or `File > Scripts > Browse...` and select the `.jsx` file.

### Step 3: Select the Target Path

The ShapeRounder dialog window will appear.
*   Use the **Select Path** dropdown menu at the top to choose the path you want to modify. The list includes all valid paths found in your document. If you had a path selected in the Paths panel before launching, it should be pre-selected.

### Step 4: Choose a Rounding Mode

Select how you want to apply rounding using the **Round Mode** dropdown:

1.  **`Edit All Points`**: (Default) Attempts to round *every* corner point on the path using the `Global Radius` and `Flatness` settings. Open path endpoints are ignored.
2.  **`Only Corners`**: Rounds only those corner points where the angle between the incoming and outgoing segments falls within the specified `Min Angle` and `Max Angle` range. Uses the `Global Radius` and `Flatness`.
3.  **`Custom Points`**: Provides a list of all points on the selected path (paginated for long paths). You can:
    *   **Check the box** next to a point (`P0`, `P1`, etc.) to enable rounding for that specific point.
    *   **Enter a unique radius** value in the text field next to the checked point. If unchecked, the point remains unchanged.
    *   Use the **Previous** / **Next** buttons to navigate through pages if the path has many points.
    *   The `Global Radius` and `Angle Filter` settings are ignored in this mode. `Flatness` still applies.

### Step 5: Configure Settings

Adjust the parameters based on your chosen mode:

*   **`Global Radius (px)`**: (Used in `Edit All Points` & `Only Corners` modes) Sets the desired radius for the rounded corners in pixels.
*   **`Flatness (%)`**: (Used in all modes) Controls the shape of the curve. 0% creates a standard circular arc approximation. Higher values flatten the curve towards the original corner point (e.g., 100% results in almost no rounding).
*   **`Min Angle (¬∞)` / `Max Angle (¬∞)`**: (Used in `Only Corners` mode) Define the angle range (0¬∞ to 180¬∞) for corners to be rounded. Use the sliders or check the numeric display.

### Step 6: Apply Rounding

*   Click the **Apply** button.
*   The script will:
    1.  Duplicate the original path and rename it (e.g., `MyPath (Original)`).
    2.  Create a new path with the rounded corners (e.g., `MyPath (Rounded)`).
    3.  Select the new rounded path in the Paths panel.

*   **Reset UI**: Click this button to revert all dialog settings to their default values.
*   **Cancel**: Click this button or close the dialog window to exit without making any changes.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Understanding the Settings

*   **Select Path:** Dropdown listing all detected vector paths (Work Paths, Shape Layer paths, Vector Mask paths) in the current document.
*   **Round Mode:**
    *   `Edit All Points`: Round all possible corners globally.
    *   `Only Corners`: Round corners based on angle criteria.
    *   `Custom Points`: Manually select points and assign individual radii.
*   **Global Radius:** The target radius (in pixels) for rounded corners when using `Edit All Points` or `Only Corners` mode.
*   **Flatness:** A percentage (0-100%) that modifies the curve's control points.
    *   `0%`: Standard circular arc approximation. The Bezier control points are placed to best emulate a circular segment.
    *   `100%`: Maximum flatness. The control points move closer to the original corner, resulting in a very tight, almost non-existent curve. Useful for subtle breaks.
    *   Intermediate values allow for stylistic variations between a sharp corner and a full arc.
*   **Min/Max Angle Filter:** Sliders (0¬∞‚Äì180¬∞) defining the range of interior corner angles to target when using `Only Corners` mode. A sharp corner (like 90¬∞ on a square) has a smaller angle, while a shallow turn has a larger angle (closer to 180¬∞).
*   **Custom Points Panel:** (Visible only in `Custom Points` mode)
    *   **Checkbox:** Enables/disables rounding for the corresponding point.
    *   **Point Label:** `P<index>` identifies the point globally across all subpaths (e.g., `P0`, `P1`, ...). Coordinates are shown for reference.
    *   **Radius Input:** Text field to enter the specific radius (in pixels) for this point *only when its checkbox is ticked*.
    *   **Pagination:** `Previous`/`Next` buttons appear if the path has more points than fit on one page (~5), allowing navigation through the list.

## üìê The Rounding Algorithm Explained

ShapeRounder employs precise calculations to create smooth, geometrically sound rounded corners.

### Bezier Arc Approximation

The core of the rounding uses a standard formula to approximate a circular arc segment with a cubic Bezier curve. For a corner point `P` with adjacent points `P_prev` and `P_next`, and a target `radius`:

1.  **Calculate the Interior Angle (Œ∏):** The angle formed by the segments `P_prev - P` and `P_next - P` is calculated.

2.  **Determine Offset Distance:** Points are moved along the segments away from the corner `P` to create space for the curve. The distance (`offset`) moved along each segment is calculated using:

    ```
    offset = min(
        radius / tan(Œ∏_rad / 2),      // Theoretical distance needed to form the arc
        distance(P, P_prev) / 2,      // Limited by length of incoming segment
        distance(P, P_next) / 2       // Limited by length of outgoing segment
    )
    ```

    Where:
    - `radius` is the desired rounding radius set by the user.
    - `Œ∏_rad` is the corner angle at point `P`, in **radians**.
    - `P` is the corner point to be rounded.
    - `P_prev` is the previous anchor point before `P` on the path.
    - `P_next` is the next anchor point after `P`.
    - `distance(a, b)` computes the Euclidean distance between points `a` and `b`.

    This ensures:
    - The curve fits safely between segments without extending too far.
    - The rounding is gracefully degraded when segments are too short.
    - The result maintains path integrity, avoiding overlaps or artifacts.

    If the calculated `offset` is near zero (due to tight geometry), rounding for that point is skipped automatically.

3.  **Calculate Bezier Handle Length (h):** The length of the Bezier control handles needed to approximate the arc is calculated using the formula:

    ```
    h = (4 / 3) * tan((œÄ - Œ∏_rad) / 4) * radius * (1 - flatness)
    ```

    Where:
    *   `Œ∏_rad` is the corner angle in radians.
    *   `radius` is the desired corner radius.
    *   `flatness` is the user-defined flatness factor (0.0 to 1.0).

4.  **Position New Control Points:**
    *   The original corner point `P` is replaced by *two* new points, `A` and `B`.
    *   The control handle for `A` (extending towards `B`) is positioned along the vector `P - A`, with length `h`.
    *   The control handle for `B` (extending towards `A`) is positioned along the vector `P - B`, with length `h`.
    *   The other handles for `A` and `B` point directly at their respective anchor points (`A.rightDirection = A.anchor`, `B.leftDirection = B.anchor`), creating a smooth transition into the curve.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Non-Destructive Workflow & Safety

ShapeRounder is designed to modify paths safely:

*   **Automatic Backup:** Before processing, the script *duplicates* the selected path. The original path is renamed by appending `(Original)` (e.g., `Path 1` becomes `Path 1 (Original)`). Your source path is never directly altered.
*   **Clear Output Naming:** The newly created path with rounded corners is named by appending `(Rounded)` to the original base name (e.g., `Path 1 (Rounded)`).
*   **Handling Name Conflicts:** If names like `Path 1 (Original)` or `Path 1 (Rounded)` already exist, the script automatically appends a counter (e.g., `Path 1 (Original) (1)`, `Path 1 (Rounded) (2)`) to ensure unique names.
*   **Error Recovery (Undo Fallback):** If an unexpected error occurs during the rounding process (e.g., due to highly complex or malformed path data), the script attempts to automatically restore the original path data to the renamed `(Original)` path item, minimizing data loss. A message will alert you if an error occurred and if restoration was attempted. You can then use Photoshop's regular Undo (`Ctrl+Z`/`Cmd+Z`) to revert the renaming and path creation steps.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Considerations

*   **No Live Preview:** Due to limitations of ExtendScript's ScriptUI, there is no live visual preview of the rounding on the canvas as you adjust parameters. You must click `Apply` to see the result.
*   **No Visual Point Markers:** The script cannot draw markers directly on the canvas to indicate which point corresponds to `P0`, `P1`, etc., in the `Custom Points` list. Users need to infer based on path order or coordinates.
*   **Single Path Processing:** The script processes only one selected path at a time. Batch processing multiple paths is not supported.
*   **ExtendScript Based:** This script uses Adobe's older ExtendScript engine. It is **not compatible** with newer UXP-based Photoshop environments directly (though it should run in modern Photoshop versions that still support ExtendScript, potentially via Rosetta on Apple Silicon).
*   **Vector Paths Only:** Cannot round corners of rasterized shapes, pixel layers, smart objects, or text layers directly. The target must be a genuine vector path.
*   **Performance:** On extremely complex paths with thousands of points, the script might take a noticeable moment to process, especially when populating the `Custom Points` list.
*   **Clipping Paths:** The script intentionally ignores paths designated as Clipping Paths to avoid unintended behavior with layer clipping.

## üöÄ Future Plans

Potential areas for future development include:

*   **UXP Plugin Rewrite:** Rebuilding the tool as a modern UXP plugin for improved performance, UI capabilities (like live preview), and future Photoshop compatibility.
*   **On-Canvas Point Identification:** Adding visual cues on the canvas to identify points selected in the UI.
*   **Live Curvature Preview:** Implementing a way to visualize the curve before applying.
*   **Radius Preset System:** Allow saving and loading common rounding configurations.
*   **Batch Processing:** Add support for rounding multiple selected paths simultaneously.
*   **Path Grouping:** Explore options for handling paths within layer groups.

## üí° Development Insights

ShapeRounder was born from a desire to bring more robust vector tools into Photoshop's environment. The development involved a deep dive into:

*   **Vector Geometry & Bezier Mathematics:** Understanding how curves are defined and manipulated.
*   **Adobe Photoshop ExtendScript API:** Navigating the intricacies of scripting Photoshop's path objects and UI.
*   **ScriptUI Development:** Crafting an interactive and user-friendly interface within ExtendScript's constraints.
*   **Algorithm Design & Edge Case Handling:** Ensuring the rounding logic is robust and handles various path configurations gracefully (open/closed paths, short segments, sharp angles).

During development, **AI assistants (ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini)** were utilized as collaborative tools for exploring mathematical concepts, generating code snippets for specific algorithms (like Bezier approximation), debugging complex logic, and refining UI layouts. Every AI-generated suggestion was critically reviewed, tested, adapted, and integrated manually to ensure correctness and alignment with the project goals. The final script represents a custom-built solution tailored specifically for this rounding task.
